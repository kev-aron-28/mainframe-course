# What are mainframes?

Highly secured computer system, design to run continously
Processes large workload at high level of utilization

A mainframe can support:

1. Thousand of input output devices
2. Applications 
3. Users

At the same time

A mainframe can run over a Million instructions per second (MIPS)

One mainframe can simultaneously run over 60 operating systems at the 
same time

# Mainframes manufacturers
- IBM and the 7 dwarfs
- IBM 90% share of the market
- Fujitsu BS2000 OS
- IBM z15 with the zOS
- Bull GCOS 
- Stratus OpenVOS
- ICL OpenVME
- Fujitsu G21
- Unisys ClearPath Libra MCP OS and ClearPath Dorado OS2200
- NEC ACOS 
- Hitachi AP10000 with VOS3
- HP NonStop

# MainFrame history
1950 -> IBM released the 700 series of MainFrames they were vacuum tube based
NO OS was installed on this Mainframes, each company had to develop their own OS

Later IBM released the 7000 series of mainframes with transistor

And in 1964 IBM released the SYSTEM 360 with the OS/360: Gene Amdahl

1970 -> SYSTEM 370
1980 -> 3081, 3091
1990 -> System 390
2000 -> Z series

# IBM system/360
Was the wordls biggest project in 1960s after apollo space mission

# Why are they still used?
1. Reliable
2. Available
3. Serviceable
4. Scalable
5. Compatibility

This is called RAS


# Fact
Stewart Alsop wrote that the last Mainframe will be unplugged on March 1996

# Os on the mainframe
A mainframe can run multiple OS at the same time. 

# Languages used on Mainframes
- Scripting: JCL (Job COntrol Language)
- Application Language: Cobol, Fortran, C, C++, Java, REXX etc
- CICS(Customer information control system): Is like a frontend for mainframe, it is used for online
transactions like airline or hotel booking
- DB: DB2, IMS, uses sql queries


# Types of data processing on Mainframes
- Batch processing
- Online Transaction Processing (OLTP):
